        <h1>Welcome to Indonesia</h1>
        <p>
            Indonesia, country located off the coast of mainland Southeast Asia in the Indian and Pacific oceans. The most populous country in Southeast Asia and the fourth most populous in the world, Indonesia is situated on an archipelago that lies across the Equator and spans a distance equivalent to one-eighth of Earthâ€™s circumference. The capital, Jakarta, is located near the northwestern coast of Java. <br><br>

            Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia, with a maximum dimension from east to west of about 3,200 miles (5,100 km) and an extent from north to south of 1,100 miles (1,800 km). Indonesia is composed of some 17,500 islands, of which more than 7,000 are uninhabited. <br><br>

            The climate of Indonesia is determined partly by its island structure and its position astride the Equator, which assure high, even temperatures. In addition, its location between the two landmasses of Asia and Australia exposes it to seasonal patterns of precipitation brought by monsoon winds.
